DOCUMENTATION.
I'm not really good with documentation, so I'm just going to freestyle it, and make changes as I go.
The app is being created with Streamlit. Streamlit basically help Data Scientists deploy code, with an
easy-to-develop frontend to interface with the ML model, or whatever data solution that has been made.

Streamlit has various ways an application can be structured, one of them is by using tabs. Previously I 
tried using a sidebar, but saw it wasn't fit for what my project will do, you can also have different 
pages like a website would have, that will kind of seperate the codes and functionaliies to it's own page,
It's something I would like to experiment, but since I have only a little experience in using Streamlit, 
I'll leave that for later.

I used 7 tabs (tab0, tab1, tab2, tab3. tab4, tab5, tab6), each tab representing a functionality provided 
by the application.
The first functionality is the "Home" tab:
Here lies a brief introduction to the application, and a dialogue or widget, that allows users to upload 
their desired file, before previewing it. It's the first Tab you see when you visit the site, and you can't 
work with any of the other features without uploading a CSV in that Tab.

The Second functionality is the "Analyze tab":
